    "summary": "I have been a programmer since 2010 and I am specialized in frontend development. I have a solid hands-on experience in product development for the web, backed by CS and cognitive science studies and I strive for elegant and future-proof solutions which are both efficient and intuitive to use.\n\nWork in large and small companies and in projects of different scale and age - past year as a project lead - has provided me insight into team dynamics and business reasoning behind the coding. I enjoy being part of the early-stage prototyping with pen and paper but most satisfaction I get when I finish building e.g. a complex mobile-first UI without a glitch.",
